# __Eat2Meet__: Why just eat when you can __Eat2Meet__?

## Overview

__Eat2Meet__ is an Android Application designed to help you find friends in cities that you may be new to! We match you with others who __share your general dining preferences__ and let you take it from there in our __custom chat-rooms__. If you are hesitant to meet complete strangers, we also allow you to find and __chat with friends-of-friends__ through our social-circle features.

Above is the __Eat2Meet__ _login page_. Notice that the user interface conforms to _Android UI application conventions_ so that users can enjoy _effective, streamlined experiences_.

## Motivation

We have gone through quite a few iterations of our design, including a major conceptual pivot. We initially developed an application, __PeopleMates__, which would help customers consolidate to-go orders but we found that the user group we decided on was too broad and the application lacked an element of social impact. We settled on __Eat2Meet__, an app that provides a unique and supportive space for people new to a neighborhood, city, etc.

_Low-Fi prototype_ additions include a _new map background and preferences menu_.

_Hi-Fi prototype_ still consists of map background with _added current location settings and a more refined preferences menu_.

## About __Eat2Meet__

__Eat2Meet__ matches users based on their __dining preferences and social circles__ (determined by users at sign-in). In addition, this app allow users to _find other Eat2Meeters nearby_ if location and timing are concerns. In the future, we plan on integrating the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) in order to make finding locations easier. We also plan on adding features that allow the user to link their account to [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) so that populating social-circles is more convenient.
